# HomePod mini radio support

Homebridge accessory for streaming radio to Homepod mini

## Streaming radio to HomePod (mini)
Main idea is to stream to HomePod mini (or AppleTV) with the following command:
```
ffmpeg -i <streamUrl> -f mp3 - | atvremote --id <homepodId> stream_file=-
```

- automatically stops streaming when homepod is used by another app
- sometimes audio streaming stops, so plugin automatically restarts it 
- "volume" setting (if specified) is used to set volume when streaming starts
- "verboseMode" - by default set to false, for debug set it to true

## Requirements 
- NodeJS (>=8.9.3) with NPM (>=6.4.1)
- ffmpeg
- pyatv

For Homepod device you need to specify the Mac address of the device. 

## Usage Example:

- Multiple radio accessories support (**each radio speaker must be added to home separately with homebridge pin pairing**):

```
{
    "platform": "HomepodRadioPlatform",
    "serialNumber": "20020105:00",
    "homepodId": "<homepod id>",
    "httpPort": 7654,
    "mediaPath": "/media/homepod",
    "radios": [
        {
            "name": "BBC - Radio 1",
            "trackName": "BBC - Radio 1",
            "radioUrl": "http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_one",
            "volume": 25,      
            "autoResume": true
        }
    ]
}
```

- Single radio accessory (legacy config):

```
{
    "platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "HomepodRadioPlatform",
            "name": "Homepod Radio",
            "model": "BBC - Radio 1",
            "homepodId": "F422F0103371",
            "radioUrl": "http://stream.live.vc.bbcmedia.co.uk/bbc_radio_one",
            "volume": 25,
            "autoResume": true,
            "httpPort": 7654,
            "mediaPath": "/media/homepod",
        }
    ]
}
```

- Trigger local mp3/wav file playback on Homepod from "mediaPath" directory on Homebridge server http://<homebridge-server-name>:7654/play/music.mp3
Example:

```
http://homebridge.local:4567/play/hello.mp3
```


## HomePod access setup

In Home app settings:

- Tap the Homes and Home Settings button.
- Tap Home Settings > Allow Speaker & TV Access, then choose "allow everyone"
- *Important!* Reboot the Homepod

## Siri support (works on iPhone/iPad)

- Create shortcut with name (for example) "Start Radio"
- Select "Control home" action, check corresponding speaker and in "Media" section select "Resume Audio")

- Say "Hey Siri, start radio" on iPhone/iPad (on HomePod mini Siri does not run it properly)


## Dependencies

### ffmpeg lib

- install ffmpeg

```
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

### PyATV lib

For streaming to HomePod we are using pyatv (https://pyatv.dev). Setup instructions (for RaspberryPi)

- install python3  
```
sudo apt-get install python3
```
- install pip3
``` 
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
- install pyatv 
```
pip3 install pyatv
```
- make atvremote available for homebridge
```
sudo ln -s /home/pi/.local/bin/atvremote /usr/local/bin/atvremote
```

## Setup steps

### Identify Homepod mini ID:
- run command:
```
atvremote scan
```
- from output select one of Identifiers:
```
       Name: HomePod
   Model/SW: HomePod Mini, tvOS 15.2
    Address: 192.168.1.7
        MAC: F4:22:F0:10:33:71
 Deep Sleep: False
Identifiers:
 - F4:22:F0:10:33:71
 - F422F0103371
```

### Stream URL format
The easieast would be to get streaming url from your favorite radio playlist (usually .m3u file)

## Known issues

1. Pairing setting for Homepod (fixed by *HomePod access setup* step):

Make sure your homepod has ```Pairing: NotNeeded``` set for RAOP protocol. Command
```
atvremote scan
```
Should show for your device:
```
Services:
 - Protocol: Companion, Port: 49152, Credentials: None, Requires Password: False, Password: None, Pairing: Unsupported
 - Protocol: AirPlay, Port: 7000, Credentials: None, Requires Password: False, Password: None, Pairing: NotNeeded
 - Protocol: RAOP, Port: 7000, Credentials: None, Requires Password: False, Password: None, Pairing: NotNeeded
```

Note: streaming will not work if you get ```Pairing: Disabled``` or ```Pairing: Unsupported```

## TODO list
1. ~~Volume control (looks like not supported by Home app with iOS 15.2 )~~
2. ~~Default volume for radio~~
3. ~~Multiple radios support~~
4. ~~Plugin Config Schema support (nice config form with Homebridge UI)~~
5. ~~Max streaming retries is set to 5 (so it gives up in case if radio or HomePod stopped working)~~
6. ~~Streaming buffer size set to 15Mb for slow streams/devices)~~ 
7. ~~Resume playback on Homebridge reboot~~
8. Set radio (track) name to homepod
9. Radio streaming to multiple homepods
10. Siri shortcuts (text to speech, etc)
